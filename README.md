# apinotes

Should be run on an Apache server using a Java EE/Web Application setup.

Project requires javax.ws.rs* and javax.json.* - Please make sure these are available in above step.

When running calls to API on host will store notes with unique id's.


Project does not include server side setup so "restarting" the service will reset the data as is.

Front end interface has not been developed.
